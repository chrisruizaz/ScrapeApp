## About

This app scrapes web sites and gives you a basic run down of what going on in some of the articles. It also allows you to save articles you like as your favorite. You can also delete articles from your favorites list. If you refresh the list it will pull more articles for you. Its a fun app that works with Scrape, mongoDB and handlebars.
